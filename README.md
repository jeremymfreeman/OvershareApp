# OvershareApp

## Overview  
**OvershareApp** is a social web application prototype that I developed with one other Computer Science student as part of our **Web Application Development (Sophomore Year Project)** course at California Baptist University.  

As the **primary developer**, I was responsible for:  
- Building the application frontend using **React, TypeScript, and Vite**  
- Designing and implementing the **feed system** where users can share thoughts, images, and videos  
- Setting up the **authentication flow** for login and registration  
- Managing project structure, tooling, and ensuring a clean, modular codebase  

My teammate focused on UI/UX design contributions, while I handled the majority of the programming and integration.  

The result was a prototype social platform with a responsive, interactive interface that demonstrates my ability to build scalable React applications with modern development practices.
